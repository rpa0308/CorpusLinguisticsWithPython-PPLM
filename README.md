Positive Pointwise Mutual Information (PPMI) is a statistical measure used to quantify the association between two events (typically words in natural language processing) in a way that emphasizes positive correlations. It is derived from Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI), which measures how much more likely two events co-occur than if they were independent.
